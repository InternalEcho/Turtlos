v1.31
Fixed:
- Streaking in refraction when camera is close to the water surface (desktop only)

v1.30
Beta shader:
- Fixed flickering in reflection when using Occlusion Culling
- Surface highlights will now appear to be affected by the waves
- Improved intersection texture animation

Fixed:
- Precision issues on mobile
- Broken normal maps in Unity 5.6 on mobile platforms (editor only issue)

Added:
- Help toggles, per options section, which show a description of the parameters
- Shader variant dropdown menu
- "Wide waves" wave animation
- Toggle to hide the wireframe on versions older than Unity 5.5

Changed:
- Rewritten inspector to make use of serialization
- Substance outputs are now baked to texture files, per material instance
- Material inspector is hidden when the StylizedWater component is used
- Normal Strength and Wave Size are now a shader function
- Improved "Billowed" heightmap
- Improved wave animation in Mobile Advanced shader

v1.29
Beta shader:
- Recompiled using latest version of ASE
- Fixed colors blowing up with HDR cameras
- Added a layer mask to the inspector for realtime reflections
- Reflection is now less intense at certain viewing angles

v1.28
Beta shader:
- Corrected transparency
- Added shallow water color parameter (replaces Depth functionality)
- "Depth" tab and "Depth darkness" parameter have been removed from the inspector
- Intensified the Rim color by default, which can be toned down by the color's alpha channel

v1.27
This version includes a separate unity package which contains a Beta shader. It's targeted at desktop, mobile shaders will follow suit later.
The minimum support version is Unity 5.4

It features:
- Recreated in Amplify Shader Editor entirely
- Realtime reflections
- Skybox lighting
- Reflection Probe support
- Mask surface highlight by heightmap (wave foam)
- Wave direction configuration
- Improved texture crosspanning
- Improved glossiness
- Unlit mode

Fixed:
- Corrected behaviour for Substance instances when reloading a scene

Changed:
- Set prefabs on "Water" layer (default built-in layer)

v1.26
Added:
- Option to use intersection texture for Surface highlights (desktop only)
- Heightmap-based wave animation, you can pick between a Smooth, Sharp and Billowed style. Great for large bodies of water! (desktop only)
- Wave tint feature, brighten or darken the surface based on the heightmap (desktop only)

Changed:
- Cleaned up Shader Forge node tree
- Increased default Anisotropic Filtering value for normal and shader map
- Surface highlights masks out the normal map to simulate thickness (desktop only)
- Surface highlights are now also affected by overall Transparency, to ensure correct color values (desktop only)
- Glossiness value can now be set higher, in case your normal map is faint and and you want to keep reflection details

Fixed:
- Missing Transparency parameter in inspector when using the Mobile Basic shader
- Undo functionality not working correctly when the inspector does not have focus
- Fallback shader on Mobile set to Unlit/Transparent, instead of referring to Legacy Shaders

v1.25
Added:
- Cells + Cloudy wave types
- Perlin intersection style

Changed:
- Minor script improvements

v1.24
Changed:
- Fixed depth banding artifact on some mobile GPU's.

v1.23
Added:
- Intersection distance parameter
- Prefabs
- Square and Circle water mesh, high-poly and low-poly variant
- Transparency parameter for Mobile Basic shader

Changed:
- Set Substance to generate all outputs by default, to avoid empty textures

Removed:
- Disabled shadow-casting in shader, as this is unwanted behaviour anyway

v1.22
Changed:
- Set Substance to 'Uncompressed' by default for Mobile
- Improved normal map blending
- Restored light reflection to its former glory

v1.21
Added:
- Shaders can now be modified using ShaderForge.
- Unity 5.5 support
- Demo scene with 30 free stylized models
- Option to randomize seed in inspector

Changed:
- Improved support for Substance material instances
- Changing materials shows/hides the new parameters automatically
- Wave vertex offset now follows the mesh's normal direction, rather than offsetting in the world Y-axis (useful for curved surfaces)
- Switched from glossiness to roughness type, for better results under low/no light conditions
- Inspector GUI improvements
- Substance will generate both texture maps regardless of "Generate all outputs" option

v1.2
Added:
- Custom inspector component for ease of use
- Fresnel color (alpha controls opacity)
- New mobile shader variant "Basic"
- Documentation now contains a parameter glossary

Changed:
- Previous mobile shader is now called "Mobile Advanced"
- Updated demo scene
- Set Substance to 'Uncompressed' for Desktop
- Mobile shader has been tweaked for performance

v1.15
Added:
- Fresnel control
- Multi-light support
- Rim color alpha now controls intersection amount
- Support for Unity 5.3.0 and up.

Changed:
- Fresnel color is now derived from Ambient Light rather than Directional Light
- UV/WorldSpace tiling values are more logical
- Reflection intensity is now bound to the glossiness parameter
- Depth control is more physically correct

v1.1
Added:
- Surface highlights.

Removed:
- Heightmap, since it was not used.

Changed:
- Name of depth buffer script to avoid conflicts.

v1.0
